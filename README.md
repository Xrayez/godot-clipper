# Godot Clipper module

# DEPRECATED

The module is no longer maintained and only critical bug fixes are accepted by
the author.

Please switch to [GeometryTools](https://github.com/Xrayez/godot-geomtools)
module which aims to cover most of the polygon clipping and offsetting needs,
with additional set of features not necessarily related to polygon operations
and more knobs to configure.
